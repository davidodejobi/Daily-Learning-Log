# PHY202 Week 1 – Introductory Video Notes

## Big Picture

* **Electric circuits and electronics power modern technology** – from smartphones to spacecraft.
* Device failures (e.g., music gadget that suddenly goes silent) often trace back to a faulty circuit.
* Mastering circuit fundamentals is essential for engineers, technicians, and electronics enthusiasts.

## Direct Current (DC) Circuits

* **DC current flows in only one direction**, from high to low potential.
* Provides a *constant* flow of electric charge.
* Serves as the starting point for understanding more complex circuit behaviour.

## Visual Analogy

> A circuit is like a **closed-loop highway** for electrons, with components acting as traffic signs and signals guiding the flow.

## Core Circuit Components

| Component                                 | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Conductors (Cables)**                   | Pathways that allow electrons to move freely                |
| **Switches**                              | Open/close the circuit to control current flow              |
| **Power Sources** (Batteries, Generators) | Supply electromotive force (EMF) that drives current        |
| **Resistors**                             | Limit current, convert electrical energy to heat            |
| **Capacitors**                            | Store energy in an electric field for rapid release         |
| **Inductors**                             | Store energy in a magnetic field, oppose changes in current |
| **Other devices**                         | Transistors, LEDs, etc. will be explored later              |

## Purpose & Energy Conversion

* Circuits **carry electric charge (electrons)** that enable energy transformation:

  * Electrical → **Heat** (heaters)
  * Electrical → **Light** (LEDs, bulbs)
  * Electrical → **Mechanical work** (motors)
* Think of it as electricity’s *magic trick*—seamlessly converting one energy form into another.

## Key Takeaways

1. DC circuits are the foundation of electronic understanding.
2. Faulty circuits manifest as everyday tech problems; knowing circuit basics allows troubleshooting.
3. Familiarity with core components prepares you for deeper topics like AC analysis, impedance, and semiconductor devices.
