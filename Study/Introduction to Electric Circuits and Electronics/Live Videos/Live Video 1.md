## 1Â Â Why Electric Circuits Matter

Modern life runs on wellâ€‘behaved electrons. From a Bluetooth speaker that suddenly goes silent to the power system of a spacecraft, **every fault ultimately traces back to a circuit problem**. Understanding how charge flows through simple elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors, transistors) is therefore the first step toward becoming an electronicsâ€‘literate engineer.

## 3Â Â Electric Circuit Fundamentals

> **Electric circuitÂ = closed conducting loop that allows current to pass.**

### 3.1Â Â Key Components & Roles

* **Conductors (Wires)** â€“ provide the lowâ€‘resistance path.
* **Switches** â€“ open/close the loop, controlling current.
* **Power Sources** â€“ batteries, generators supply EMF (E).
* **Resistors (R)** â€“ limit current & set voltage drops.
* **Capacitors (C)** â€“ store / release electric field energy.
* **Inductors (L)** â€“ store energy in magnetic field; oppose changes in current.

### 3.2Â Â Common Schematic Symbols

## 4Â Â Fundamental Laws

### 4.1Â Â Ohmâ€™s Law

> The current $I$ through a conductor is **directly proportional** to the applied voltage $V$ and **inversely proportional** to its resistance $R$:
> $\displaystyle I = \frac{V}{R}$

Triangle mnemonic:

```
      V
    â”€â”€â”€â”€
    I â”‚ R
```

Therefore also $V = I R$ and $R = V / I$.

### 4.2Â Â Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws

1. **KCL (Current Law)** â€“ Sum of currents entering a node = sum leaving (charge conservation).
2. **KVL (Voltage Law)** â€“ Algebraic sum of voltages around any closed loop = 0 (energy conservation).

These are the foundation for meshâ€‘current and nodeâ€‘voltage analysis you will meet in coming weeks.
