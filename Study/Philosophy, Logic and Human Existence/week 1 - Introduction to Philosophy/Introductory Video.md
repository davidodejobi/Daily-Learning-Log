## 6. Common Misconceptions

| Misconception                           | Reality                                                         |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Philosophy is abstract and impractical. | It underpins science, law, and everyday decision‑making.        |
| Philosophers never reach conclusions.   | Philosophers build and refine arguments that guide many fields. |
| A personal motto equals a philosophy.   | Genuine philosophy demands systematic reasoning and evidence.   |

## 7. Learning Tips

* Keep a **question journal**—record ideas you find puzzling.
* Reconstruct arguments in **standard form**: list premises, then conclusion.
* Practice spotting **hidden assumptions** in articles or debates.
* Discuss topics with peers to **refine understanding**.
