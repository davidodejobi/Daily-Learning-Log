# Theories of Philosophy

## Learning Objectives

* Define **theories of philosophy** and explain their purpose.
* Identify the central problem each theory addresses.
* Describe the core claims of six major theories: **Monism, Dualism, Rationalism, Empiricism, Deontologism, and Utilitarianism**.
* Recognise classic proponents and contemporary applications.

## 1  What Are “Theories of Philosophy”?

Philosophical theories are organised systems of thought that philosophers develop to answer fundamental questions about reality, knowledge, morality, and human existence. Think of them as specialised tools in a philosophical toolbox—each suited to a different kind of “big question.”

| Branch           | Guiding Question               | Example Theories             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| **Metaphysics**  | What is ultimately real?       | Monism, Dualism              |
| **Epistemology** | How do we know what we know?   | Rationalism, Empiricism      |
| **Ethics**       | What is the right thing to do? | Deontologism, Utilitarianism |

## 2  Metaphysical Theories

### 2.1  Monism

* **Etymology:** *monos* (Greek) – “single” or “alone.”
* **Core Claim:** All reality reduces to a single substance or principle.

  * **Material Monism:** Everything is ultimately physical (e.g., early Greek materialists who traced all to water or fire).
  * **Idealistic Monism:** Reality is fundamentally mental or spiritual (e.g., Berkeley – “To be is to be perceived”).
  * **Neutral Monism:** Mind and matter are two aspects of one underlying neutral stuff.
* **Key Thinkers:** Parmenides, Spinoza.
* **Why It Matters:** Forces us to seek unity where diversity appears—useful in debates on consciousness and the physical universe.

### 2.2  Dualism

* **Etymology:** *duo* (Latin) – “two.”
* **Core Claim:** Reality consists of two fundamentally distinct substances—physical (material) and immaterial (mental or spiritual).
* **Key Thinkers:** Plato (Theory of Forms); René Descartes (mind–body dualism, *cogito ergo sum*).
* **Contemporary Relevance:** Shapes discussions on consciousness, personal identity, AI, and afterlife beliefs.

**Quick Contrast**

| Question                                          | Monism                                  | Dualism           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| How many basic kinds of “stuff” exist?            | One                                     | Two               |
| Response to “Is the mind separate from the body?” | No (mind = body or both aspects of one) | Yes (mind ≠ body) |

## 3  Epistemological Theories

### 3.1  Rationalism

* **Etymology:** *ratio* (Latin) – “reason.”
* **Core Claim:** Significant knowledge is gained **a priori** (independently of the senses) through innate ideas or pure reason.
* **Classic Example:** Mathematical truths (2 + 2 = 4) are knowable by thinking alone.
* **Key Thinkers:** Plato, Descartes, Leibniz.
* **Modern Use:** Foundations of mathematics, logic, and formal systems.

### 3.2  Empiricism

* **Etymology:** *empeiria* (Greek) – “experience.”
* **Core Claim:** All knowledge starts with sensory experience; the mind is a “blank slate” (tabula rasa).
* **Key Thinkers:** Aristotle, John Locke, David Hume.
* **Applications:** Scientific method → hypothesis testing via observation and experiment.

**Comparison Snapshot**

| Feature             | Rationalism                                                     | Empiricism                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Source of knowledge | Reason & innate ideas                                           | Sensory experience                                            |
| Example statement   | “I can prove the triangle’s angles sum to 180° by logic alone.” | “Water boils at 100 °C (at sea level) because we observe it.” |

## 4  Ethical Theories

### 4.1  Deontologism (Duty‑Based Ethics)

* **Etymology:** *deon* (Greek) – “duty” + *logos* – “study.”
* **Core Claim:** The moral worth of an action depends on the action’s intrinsic nature, not its consequences.
* **Key Thinker:** **Immanuel Kant** – Categorical Imperative: act only on maxims you can will as universal law.
* **Everyday Illustration:** Lying is wrong even if a lie might yield good outcomes.

### 4.2  Utilitarianism (Consequentialist Ethics)

* **Etymology:** *utility* – usefulness/benefit + *‑arianism* (adherent of a doctrine).
* **Core Claim:** An action is right if it produces “the greatest good for the greatest number.”
* **Key Thinkers:** Jeremy Bentham (act utilitarianism), John Stuart Mill (rule utilitarianism).
* **Contemporary Application:** Public‑policy cost–benefit analysis, resource allocation, triage decisions.

**Duty vs Consequence at a Glance**

| Scenario: Divert a runaway trolley to save five people but kill one on the side track. |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deontologism:** Killing an innocent is intrinsically wrong; do not divert.           |
| **Utilitarianism:** Saving five > losing one; divert the trolley.                      |

## 5  Mid‑Lesson Reflection Questions

1. Which metaphysical theory—monism or dualism—best explains consciousness? Why?
2. Give a real‑world example where empiricism outperforms rationalism in acquiring knowledge.
3. Describe a dilemma you faced where your sense of duty conflicted with the greater good. How did you decide?
4. Can a neutral monist framework bridge the mind–body gap better than dualism? Discuss briefly.

## 6  Summary

* **Monism & Dualism** address the **nature of reality**.
* **Rationalism & Empiricism** tackle the **source of knowledge**.
* **Deontologism & Utilitarianism** provide rival frameworks for **moral decision‑making**.
* Together these theories equip us with diverse tools for analysing existence, knowing, and acting responsibly.
