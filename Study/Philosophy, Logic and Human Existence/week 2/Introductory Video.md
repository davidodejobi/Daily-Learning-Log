# Branches of Philosophy
# Week 2 – The Five Major Branches of Philosophy

## Learning Objectives

* Identify and explain Metaphysics, Epistemology, Ethics, Logic, and Aesthetics.
* Connect each branch to guiding questions, landmark thinkers, and everyday decisions.

## 1. Quick Reference Table

| Branch           | Core Questions                                      | Landmark Thinkers                 | Practical Lens                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Metaphysics**  | What is ultimately real? Does the immaterial exist? | Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant | Spirituality, causality, time, free will |
| **Epistemology** | What is knowledge? How is truth justified?          | Plato, Descartes, Locke, Gettier  | Scientific method, media literacy        |
| **Ethics**       | What ought we do? What is good?                     | Aristotle, Kant, Mill, Nietzsche  | Bioethics, business ethics               |
| **Logic**        | What counts as valid reasoning?                     | Aristotle, Russell, Gödel         | Courtroom arguments, algorithm design    |
| **Aesthetics**   | What is beauty? How judge art?                      | Plato, Kant, Schiller, Tolstoy    | Product design, music criticism          |

## 2. Metaphysics – Beyond the Physical

* **Etymology:** *meta* (beyond) + *physis* (nature).
* **Scope:** reality, existence of God or spirits, time, causality, mind–body relation.
* **Classic Ideas:**

  * **Plato:** Theory of Forms – eternal prototypes behind changing particulars.
  * **Aristotle:** Substance & accident; four causes.
  * **Descartes:** Cartesian dualism – thinking substance vs extended substance.
  * **Kant:** Distinction between phenomena (what we perceive) and noumena (things‑in‑themselves).
* **Sample Thought Experiment:** If a perfect chair exists only in an ideal realm, how do we recognise imperfect chairs on earth?

## 3. Epistemology – The Study of Knowledge

* **Etymology:** *epistēmē* (knowledge) + *logos* (study).
* **Key Questions:** What can we know? How certain can we be? What justifies belief?
* **Major Debates:** Rationalism vs empiricism; skepticism; foundationalism vs coherentism; Gettier problem.
* **Historical Milestones:**

  * **Descartes:** Methodic doubt – cogito ergo sum.
  * **Locke:** Tabula rasa – mind begins as blank slate; knowledge via experience.
  * **Contemporary:** Reliabilism, virtue epistemology.
* **Practical Angle:** Fake‑news detection relies on epistemic standards of evidence and justification.

## 4. Ethics – Theories of Right Action and Good Character

* **Etymology:** *ethikos* (character/morals).
* **Central Questions:** What is the good life? What duties do we have? Are outcomes or intentions primary?
* **Major Frameworks:**

  * **Virtue Ethics** (Aristotle) – cultivate excellence of character.
  * **Deontology** (Kant) – act according to maxims you can will as universal law.
  * **Utilitarianism** (Mill) – maximise overall happiness.
  * **Nietzsche’s Re‑evaluation** – beyond conventional (“slave”) morality.
* **Case Study:** Is killing always wrong? Compare self‑defence, war, capital punishment.

## 5. Logic – The Science of Correct Reasoning

* **Etymology:** *logikē* from *logos* (reason).
* **Kinds:** Deductive vs inductive; formal vs informal; modal; mathematical logic.
* **Notable Advances:**

  * **Aristotle:** Syllogism structure (All men are mortal…).
  * **Russell & Whitehead:** *Principia Mathematica* – logicism.
  * **Gödel:** Incompleteness theorems – limits of formal systems.
* **Courtroom Example:** An appeal to pity (ad misericordiam) fallacy in the politician’s defence highlights invalid persuasion.

## 6. Aesthetics – Philosophy of Beauty and Art

* **Etymology:** *aisthēsis* (perception/feeling).
* **Focus:** Nature of beauty, criteria for artistic value, emotional responses to art.
* **Historical Trajectory:**

  * **Plato:** Suspicion of art as imitation.
  * **Kant:** Disinterested judgment of beauty; sublime vs beautiful.
  * **Schiller:** Aesthetic education fosters freedom.
* **Reflective Questions:** What makes your favourite song moving? Is beauty universal or culturally relative?

## 7. Discussion & Practice Exercises

1. **Metaphysics:** Does the flow of time objectively exist, or is it a feature of human consciousness?
2. **Epistemology:** Outline a real‑life example where eyewitness testimony failed reliability tests.
3. **Ethics:** Analyse the trolley problem through utilitarian, deontological, and virtue‑ethics lenses.
4. **Logic:** Identify the fallacy in: “If we allow AI in classrooms, teachers will lose their jobs, so AI must be banned.”
5. **Aesthetics:** Compare two songs or artworks you love. What aesthetic principles inform your preference?

## 8. Quick Recap

* The five branches map the terrain of philosophical inquiry: reality, knowledge, morality, rationality, and beauty.
* Mastery of these lenses deepens critical thinking and enriches everyday decision‑making.
