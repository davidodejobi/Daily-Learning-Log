### **1. Introduction to Parallel Processing**

- **Definition:** A method enabling a system to execute multiple data-processing tasks simultaneously to enhance computational speed.
    
- **Key Concepts:**
    
    - **Concurrency:** Multiple tasks progress at the same time but not necessarily executing simultaneously (time-slicing).
        
    - **Parallelism:** True simultaneous execution using multiple processors/cores.

### **2. Importance of Parallel Processing**

- **Scalability:** Large problems can be broken into smaller sub-problems solved concurrently.
    
- **Efficiency:** Faster execution by distributing workloads.
    
- **Application Example:** Weather forecasting models requiring vast data processing.

### **3. Multiprocessing**

- **Definition:** Two or more processors handle separate portions of a program simultaneously.
    
- **Types:**
    
    - **Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):** Shared memory, single OS, unified I/O bus.
        
    - **Asymmetric Multiprocessing (AMP):** Each processor runs its own OS image, may share physical memory.

### **4. Multithreading**

- **Definition:** Multiple threads (smaller units of a process) executed by a single CPU/core.
    
- **Benefits:**
    
    - Improved responsiveness.
        
    - Efficient CPU resource usage.
        
- **Drawbacks:**
    
    - Complexity, debugging difficulty, overhead.
        
- **Example:** Web browser loading multiple tabs concurrently.

### **6. Parallel Architectures**

#### **a. SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**

- Executes the same instruction across multiple data points.
    
- **Example:** Vector processing in graphics rendering.
    
- **Pros:** Efficient for uniform data operations.
    
- **Cons:** Limited to vectorisable tasks.
    

#### **b. MIMD (Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data)**

- Executes different instructions on different datasets simultaneously.
    
- **Example:** Server handling database queries, web requests, and email.
    
- **Pros:** Flexible, handles diverse tasks.
    
- **Cons:** Complex to implement and manage.

### **7. Challenges in Parallel Processing**

- **Synchronisation:** Coordinating threads/processes to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
    
- **Data Dependency:** Managing task dependencies to ensure correct execution.
    
- **Load Balancing:** Evenly distributing workload to prevent processor idling.

### **8. Strategies for Effective Parallel Processing**

- **Decomposition:** Break tasks into smaller sub-tasks.
    
- **Pipelining:** Process stages in parallel.
    
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Assign tasks based on workload.
    
- **Data Partitioning:** Divide data into chunks for parallel execution.
    
- **Algorithm Optimisation:** Design algorithms suited for parallel execution.
    
- **Scalability & Fault Tolerance:** Maintain efficiency and handle failures.
