### **1. Introduction to I/O Devices**

- **Examples of I/O devices:**
    
    - **Output devices:** Monitor, speaker.
        
    - **Input devices:** Keyboard, mouse, microphone.
        
- **Purpose of I/O systems:** Manage data flow between the CPU/memory and peripheral devices.

### **2. Overview of I/O Systems in Computers**

- **Definition:** I/O systems facilitate the transfer of data to and from the central processor and memory.
    
- **Peripheral devices include:**
    
    - Input: Keyboard, mouse, microphone.
        
    - Output: Displays, printers.
        
    - Storage: Hard drives, SSDs.
        
    - Network connections: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
        
- **Role:** The I/O system coordinates communication between peripherals and CPU/memory subsystems.

### **3. Trends in I/O Device Connectivity**

- **Standard connections:** Make it easier to add new devices.
    
- **Special connections:** Some devices require unique interfaces, making integration harder.

### **4. I/O Interfaces and Controllers**

- **Purpose:** Electrically connect peripherals to the system bus linking CPU and memory.
    
- **Examples of controllers:**
    
    - **USB controllers:** Connect devices like keyboards, webcams, external drives.
        
    - **Display controllers:** Manage monitors.
        
    - **Network interface cards (NICs):** Handle Ethernet/Wi-Fi.
        
    - **Storage controllers:** Manage HDDs and SSDs.
        
- **Function:** Controllers act as translators, converting high-level OS/CPU commands into device-specific low-level instructions.

### **5. I/O Operation Techniques**

#### **a. Programmed I/O (Polling)**

- CPU executes special I/O instructions.
    
- Directly passes commands/data to I/O controllers.
    
- Monitors status registers until operations are complete.
    
- **Advantage:** Simple implementation.
    
- **Disadvantage:** Inefficient because CPU constantly monitors I/O, reducing time for other tasks.
    

#### **b. Interrupt-Driven I/O**

- CPU initiates I/O, then continues other work.
    
- I/O controller sends a hardware interrupt when it needs CPU attention.
    
- CPU runs an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) to handle data transfer.
    
- **Advantage:** Saves CPU cycles by avoiding constant polling.
    

#### **c. Direct Memory Access (DMA)**

- Special DMA controller transfers data directly between devices and memory.
    
- CPU sets source, destination, and size, then DMA manages the transfer.
    
- CPU is interrupted only after completion.
    
- **Advantage:** Ideal for large data transfers; offloads CPU.
    
- **Common uses:** Disk drives, network cards, graphics cards.

### **6. Example Workflow (Downloading a Large Video File)**

1. Browser sends network request.
    
2. Network cardâ€™s interrupt handler processes packets.
    
3. DMA transfers data from network card to memory.
    
4. CPU is interrupted once the file is fully received.
    
5. Browser reads the file and sends it to the video renderer.
    
6. Video data is DMA-transferred to the graphics card.
    
7. Graphics card uses DMA to send rendered frames to the display controller.
    
8. CPU is only interrupted when necessary; high-bandwidth transfers are handled by DMA.

### **7. Key Takeaways**

- Modern I/O systems use a combination of:
    
    - Interfaces
        
    - Controllers
        
    - Interrupts
        
    - DMA
        
- This setup maximizes CPU efficiency and allows smooth operation of data-intensive applications.
    
- Separation of duties enables high computational performance alongside robust peripheral support.
