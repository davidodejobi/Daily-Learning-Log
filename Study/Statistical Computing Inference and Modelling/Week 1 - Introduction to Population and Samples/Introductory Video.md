## ðŸ§  Overview

In this session on **Statistical Computing: Inference and Modeling II**, the foundational concepts of **populations** and **samples** were explored, along with the key **sampling techniques** used to draw representative subsets for analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

* The session defined and distinguished between populations and samples.
* The importance and process of sampling were explained.
* Various **probability sampling** methods were described and compared.
* Various **non-probability sampling** methods were described and compared.
* The need for obtaining a representative sample was emphasized.

## 1. Population vs. Sample

| Term           | Definition                                                                 | Analogy             |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Population** | The entire group of individuals or items that the research aimed to study. | The whole cake      |
| **Sample**     | A subset of the population selected to represent it in analysis.           | A slice of the cake |

> **Key Point:** Conclusions about the population were drawn from data collected in the sample.

## 2. The Sampling Process

1. The *target population* was defined in concrete terms.
2. A subset (sample) was selected using a chosen technique.
3. Data were collected from the sample.
4. Analysis was performed, and inferences were made about the population.

> Sampling enabled the study of large populations when full enumeration was impractical.

## 3. Probability Sampling

Each member of the population had a known, non-zero chance of being selected.

### 3.1 Simple Random Sampling

* Every individual had an **equal** chance of selection.
* Example: A random number generator was used on a class roster.

### 3.2 Systematic Sampling

* A **random starting point** was chosen, then every *k<sup>th</sup>* individual was selected.
* Example: Every 10th customer was surveyed after the initial random start.

### 3.3 Stratified Sampling

* The population was divided into **strata** based on characteristics.
* Samples were drawn **proportionally** from each stratum.
* Example: Equal samples were taken from each grade level.

### 3.4 Cluster Sampling

* The population was divided into **clusters** (e.g., neighborhoods).
* Entire randomly selected clusters were included.
* Example: Random neighborhoods were chosen, and all residents were surveyed.

## 4. Non-Probability Sampling

Selection was **not** based on known probabilities.

### 4.1 Convenience Sampling

* Participants were chosen based on **availability**.
* Example: Survey respondents were those encountered on the street.

### 4.2 Purposive (Judgmental) Sampling

* Participants were selected based on **specific criteria**.
* Example: Experts in a particular field were interviewed.

### 4.3 Snowball Sampling

* Initial participants referred additional participants.
* Example: Referrals were used to reach hidden populations.

### 4.4 Quota Sampling

* **Quotas** were set to ensure representation of key characteristics.
* Example: Equal numbers from each age group were included.

## 5. Importance of Representative Samples

* The session illustrated that biased samples can lead to **incorrect** conclusions.
* Representative samples were shown to capture **variability** across the population.
* Example: Sampling birds from all forest regions ensured accurate conclusions about bird diversity.

> **Takeaway:** Accurate statistical conclusions depend on how well the sample reflects the target population.

## 6. Review & Reflection

1. Why was defining the target population with precision critical?
2. How did stratified and cluster sampling differ in this session?
3. What were the potential risks of convenience sampling?
4. How could representative sampling be ensured in a large-scale survey?
