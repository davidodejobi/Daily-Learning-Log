## 📌 Introduction to Differential Equations  
- A **differential equation** involves **unknown functions** and their **derivatives**.  
- They describe how quantities **change over time or space**.  
- These equations help model **real-world phenomena** from science, engineering, biology, and more.  
- The challenge is to **convert real-world processes** into mathematical equations.

## 📌 Types of Differential Equations  

### 🔸 **1. First-Order Differential Equations**  
These involve **only the first derivative** of the unknown function.  
Example:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)
\]
Common in problems involving **rates of change**, **growth**, or **decay**.

#### 🔹 Types of First-Order Equations:  
1️⃣ **Linear Equations**:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
\]  
- \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are functions of \( x \).  
- The equation is **linear** because \( y \) and its derivative appear to the first power.  

2️⃣ **Separable Equations**:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)
\]
- Can separate variables:
\[
\frac{dy}{g(y)} = f(x) dx
\]
- Integrate both sides.  

3️⃣ **Bernoulli Equations**:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)y^n
\]
- Nonlinear if \( n \neq 0, 1 \).  

4️⃣ **Riccati Equations**:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) + g(x)y + h(x)y^2
\]

5️⃣ **Homogeneous Equations**:  
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = F\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
\]

6️⃣ **Exact and Non-Exact Equations**:  
- Written as:
\[
M(x,y)dx + N(x,y)dy = 0
\]
- Exact if:
\[
\frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
\]

### 🔸 **2. Second-Order Differential Equations**  
These involve the **second derivative** of the unknown function.  
\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = f(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx})
\]
- Important for modeling **oscillatory, vibrational, and mechanical systems**.

#### 🔹 Types of Second-Order Equations:  
1️⃣ **Linear Second-Order**:
\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + P(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + Q(x)y = R(x)
\]
- **Homogeneous** if \( R(x)=0 \), otherwise **non-homogeneous**.

2️⃣ **Nonlinear Second-Order**:
\[
\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = f(x,y,\frac{dy}{dx})
\]
- Complex, often solved numerically.

---

### 🔸 **3. Higher-Order Linear Differential Equations**  
- **Order higher than 2**, e.g. third-order, fourth-order.  
\[
a_n(x)\frac{d^n y}{dx^n} + \cdots + a_1(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + a_0(x)y = f(x)
\]
- **Linear** if \( y \) and its derivatives appear to the first power.

## 📌 Summary of Key Concepts  
✅ **Differential equations** model how things change over time or space.  
✅ Can be **ordinary (ODEs)** or **partial (PDEs)** (focus here is ODEs).  
✅ Can be **linear** (simpler) or **nonlinear** (more complex).  
✅ **First-order equations** describe rates of change and can be separable, linear, Bernoulli, etc.  
✅ **Second-order equations** describe more complex dynamics (e.g., vibrations).  
✅ **Higher-order equations** involve higher derivatives and model systems with more complex behavior.
