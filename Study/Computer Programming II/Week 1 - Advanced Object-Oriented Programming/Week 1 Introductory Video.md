# Weekâ€¯1: Core Principles of OOP in C++ â€“ Polymorphism, Abstract Classes & Interfaces

*(Derived from the Weekâ€¯1 introductory video transcript)*

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

* Define **polymorphism** and distinguish its compileâ€‘time vs runâ€‘time forms.
* Explain the roles of **abstract classes** and **interfaces** in C++ design.
* Recognise how polymorphism enables robust and flexible software.

## 1  Opening Analogy â€“ Yearbook Picture Day

The lecturer likens *polymorphism* to students posing differently in front of the **same backdrop** during picture day. All respond to the same "Take a photo" event, yet each expresses unique identityâ€”mirroring how objects share an interface but perform diverse actions.

## 2  What Is Polymorphism?

> **Polymorphism** ("many forms") is an OOP pattern where multiple classes provide **different implementations** while sharing a **common interface** (baseâ€‘class function signatures).

### 2.1 Static (Compileâ€‘Time) Polymorphism

* Resolved during compilation.
* Achieved via **function/method overloading** or **operator overloading** in C++.
* Example: Same function name `area()` with different parameter lists for circle vs rectangle.

### 2.2 Dynamic (Runâ€‘Time) Polymorphism

* Resolved while the program is running.
* Achieved via **method overriding** in inheritance hierarchies, using **virtual functions**.
* Selecting the correct method relies on the objectâ€™s *actual* (derived) type, not the pointer/reference type.

## 3  Code Illustration â€“ Animal Hierarchy

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cout; using std::endl;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void makeSound() const { cout << "Unknown" << endl; }
    virtual ~Animal() = default;
};

class Lion : public Animal {
public: void makeSound() const override { cout << "Roar!" << endl; } };
class Bird : public Animal {
public: void makeSound() const override { cout << "Chirp!" << endl; } };
class Snake : public Animal {
public: void makeSound() const override { cout << "Hiss!" << endl; } };

int main() {
    Animal* zoo[] { new Lion, new Bird, new Snake };
    for (Animal* a : zoo) a->makeSound();   // dynamic dispatch
    for (Animal* a : zoo) delete a;
}
```

**Key Takeaways**

* `virtual` enables runâ€‘time dispatch.
* Base pointer interacts with multiple derived behaviours â†’ polymorphism.
* Ensures extensibility (add `Elephant` without editing existing code).

## 4  Abstract Classes & Interfaces (Preview)

While the video teaser focuses on polymorphism, it hints at upcoming **abstract classes** and **interfaces**:

* **Abstract class** â€“ cannot be instantiated; contains at least one *pure virtual* function (`=0`). Acts as a blueprint.
* **Interface** (in C++ parlance, a class with *only* pure virtual functions) â€“ defines contract without implementation, enabling multiple inheritance of behaviour contracts.

These constructs underpin polymorphism by guaranteeing a common function set across diverse derived classes.

## 5  Practical Benefits

1. **Flexibility** â€“ swap or extend behaviours without altering callers.
2. **Robustness** â€“ code targets abstractions, reducing coupling.
3. **Maintainability** â€“ new features added via new subclasses, not giant switchâ€‘cases.
