Demo-day disaster: one missing null crashed my first app, and it became the best lesson of my career.

During my first internship, I was the lone mobile dev on a hand-off project. After marathon days clearing bug tickets, I stepped up to demo. Mid-presentation, someone deleted a database record. My code had zero null-safety checks, the screen went _Scadoosh_ (That flutter red error screen ðŸ¥²), and the team stared at me in silence (Actually, some laughed and I could feel it in my bones ðŸ˜…).

Instead of calling it a failure, I treated it as tuition:

Guardrails first â€“ validate every input, assume nothing in production is perfect.
Ask early â€“ team leads and teammates shorten the learning curve.
Ship, break, patch, repeat â€“ progress hides inside fast iterations.
Detach ego â€“ problems in the code are not a verdict on the coder.

That mindset now powers every feature I ship, including **Quiver**, the AI study companion I am building. Long nights of refactoring feel like an investment, not a punishment, and the payoff is sturdier apps and calmer demos.

This lesson doesn't just apply to developers but to everyone in other industries and walks of life. There are going to be times when things are not going to work; there are times we might even fail at something, but one thing we must remember is that those things do not define us but are only there for a time and if we looks critically at those situation, they are only there to make not mar us.

  

I wish I had taken up more things alone in the past years: learned more programming lanugages (at least one every year), failed more and have more bugs while working with them and learninf from those processes but today is another day and I can still rewrite the course of history so do youÂ 

  

If you are juggling school, side projects, or a new role, remember that rough edges are part of the journey. Handle them, learn, and keep shipping.Â
