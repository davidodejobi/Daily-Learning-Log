# Swift `for` Loops ‚Äì Practical Overview

## üîÅ Why Loops Matter

* Computers excel at repetitive tasks.
* Swift‚Äôs `for` loop lets you repeat code:

  * A fixed number of times.
  * For every item in an array, dictionary, or set.

---

## üì¶ Looping Over Collections

```swift
let platforms = ["iOS", "macOS", "tvOS", "watchOS"]

for os in platforms {
    print("Swift works great on \(os).")
}
```

* `os` is the **loop variable**.
* The loop body runs once for each item in the array.
* `os` is only available inside the loop.

### üß† Terms to Know

* **Loop body** ‚Äì the code inside `{}`.
* **Loop iteration** ‚Äì one run of the loop body.
* **Loop variable** ‚Äì `os`, `name`, or whatever you call it; scoped to the loop.

### Loop Variable Naming

```swift
for name in platforms {
    print("Swift works great on \(name).")
}

for rubberChicken in platforms {
    print("Swift works great on \(rubberChicken).")
}
```

* The variable name is up to you.
* Xcode suggests intelligent loop variable names using singular/plural inference.

## üî¢ Looping Over Ranges

```swift
for i in 1...12 {
    print("5 x \(i) is \(5 * i)")
}
```

* `1...12` creates a **closed range**.
* Common loop variable: `i`, `j`, `k`, etc.
* Each iteration gives a new value from 1 to 12.

---

## üîÅ Nested Loops

```swift
for i in 1...12 {
    print("The \(i) times table:")

    for j in 1...12 {
        print("  \(j) x \(i) is \(j * i)")
    }

    print() // Adds a blank line
}
```

* Useful for multi-dimensional data or multiplication tables.
* `print()` with no argument creates a blank line.

---

## üîÑ Half-Open Ranges: `..<`

```swift
for i in 1...5 {
    print("Counting from 1 through 5: \(i)")
}

print()

for i in 1..<5 {
    print("Counting 1 up to 5: \(i)")
}
```

* `...` includes the upper bound.
* `..<` excludes the upper bound.
* Read as: "1 through 5" vs. "1 up to 5".
* Useful for array indexing.

---

## üîÅ Looping Without a Variable

```swift
var lyric = "Haters gonna"

for _ in 1...5 {
    lyric += " hate"
}

print(lyric)
```

* Use `_` when you don‚Äôt need the loop variable.
* Keeps your code cleaner.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* `for` loops repeat tasks over a sequence.
* Loop over arrays, dictionaries, sets, or ranges.
* Use `...` to include the upper bound, `..<` to exclude it.
* Replace unused loop variables with `_`.
* Combine loops for more complex operations.

---

# Swift `while` Loops

## üîÅ What Is a `while` Loop?

* Executes code **as long as a condition is true**.
* Less common than `for` loops but useful when the number of iterations isn't known beforehand.

---

## üßÆ Basic `while` Loop Example

```swift
var countdown = 10

while countdown > 0 {
    print("\(countdown)‚Ä¶")
    countdown -= 1
}

print("Blast off!")
```

* Starts from 10 and decrements down to 0.
* The loop stops when the condition `countdown > 0` becomes false.

---

## üé≤ Using `random(in:)` with `while`

### Generate Random Numbers

```swift
let id = Int.random(in: 1...1000)
let amount = Double.random(in: 0...1)
```

### Critical Hit Dice Rolling Example

```swift
var roll = 0

while roll != 20 {
    roll = Int.random(in: 1...20)
    print("I rolled a \(roll)")
}

print("Critical hit!")
```

* This continues until a 20 is rolled.
* `random(in:)` is useful for generating random values.

---

## üÜö `for` vs `while`

| Feature     | `for` Loop                  | `while` Loop                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Usage       | Known number of iterations  | Unknown number of iterations      |
| Best For    | Arrays, ranges, collections | Loops with custom exit conditions |
| Readability | Clear for fixed loops       | More flexible, less structured    |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* Use `while` when the loop length depends on a condition, not a count.
* Loop continues **until the condition becomes false**.
* Great for working with randomness, user input, or continuous tasks.
* Prefer `for` when iterating over known collections or ranges.

---

# Swift Loop Control: `continue` and `break`

Swift provides two key ways to control loop execution:

* `continue`: skips the **current** iteration.
* `break`: exits the **entire** loop immediately.

---

## üîÅ Using `continue`

* Use `continue` to **skip over** items that don‚Äôt meet a condition.

### Example

```swift
let filenames = ["me.jpg", "work.txt", "sophie.jpg", "logo.psd"]

for filename in filenames {
    if !filename.hasSuffix(".jpg") {
        continue
    }
    print("Found picture: \(filename)")
}
```

* If the filename doesn‚Äôt end with `.jpg`, it skips the print statement.
* Only `.jpg` files get printed.

---

## üõë Using `break`

* Use `break` to **terminate** the entire loop early.

### Example

```swift
let number1 = 4
let number2 = 14
var multiples = [Int]()

for i in 1...100_000 {
    if i.isMultiple(of: number1) && i.isMultiple(of: number2) {
        multiples.append(i)

        if multiples.count == 10 {
            break
        }
    }
}

print(multiples)
```

* Appends common multiples of 4 and 14.
* Once 10 are found, it stops checking further numbers.

---

## üîÑ Summary

| Statement  | Behavior                                 |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `continue` | Skips the current iteration and moves on |
| `break`    | Exits the loop immediately               |

* Use `continue` when **some items should be ignored**.
* Use `break` when **you want to stop looping altogether**.
* Especially useful when optimizing for performance or readability in loops.

These keywords are especially helpful in filtering or early exit scenarios.
