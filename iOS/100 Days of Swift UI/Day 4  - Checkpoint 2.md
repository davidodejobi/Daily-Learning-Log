# Swift Collections Checkpoint Challenge

## 🧪 Checkpoint: Arrays, Sets, and Count

You’ve now learned about arrays, dictionaries, and sets in Swift. This checkpoint will help you test your understanding and reinforce what you’ve studied.

### ✅ Task

1. Create an **array of strings** with at least a few duplicates.
2. Print the **total number of items** in the array.
3. Print the **number of unique items** in the array.

### 💡 Key Concepts to Remember

* Arrays store **ordered** values and allow **duplicates**.
* Sets store **unordered**, **unique** values.
* You can use `.count` to find out how many items are in an array or set.

### ❓ Questions to Guide You

* How do you define an array of strings?
* How do you count the number of items in an array?
* How can you extract only unique values from an array?
* What method helps you determine the number of unique items?

Take some time to attempt this on your own before checking any solution.
